<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<br/>
Senior citizens in India are increasingly becoming targets of sophisticated cyber-fraud, particularly the "Digital Arrest"  
scam. In these scenarios, fraudsters impersonate law enforcement or government officials, using psychological manipulation, fear, and technical mimicry to convince elderly individuals that they are under "digital arrest" for alleged illegal activities. This demographic is particularly vulnerable due to a combination of limited digital literacy, high respect for authority, and isolation. Victims are often coerced into transferring life savings into "safety accounts" while being kept on continuous video calls to prevent them from seeking help or consulting others.
<h3> SOLUTION <h3/>
  Rakshak 1930 is a senior-friendly cybersecurity awareness and protection website designed to prevent “Digital Arrest” scams targeting elderly citizens in India. The platform provides a simple scam detection tool that analyzes suspicious messages using keyword-based logic and alerts users about potential fraud.

The website also offers instant emergency guidance, clearly displays the national cybercrime helpline (1930), and educates users about common scam tactics such as impersonation of law enforcement and fear-based manipulation.
